# Sudoku

This project uses the pygame and Tkinter libraries.

You have to install them first, by running the following commands:

```pip3 install pygame```

```pip3 install tkinter```

Just paste the commands, one by one, in your terminal, or just type them out.

Be sure to install all the fonts provided in the fonts folder, or you **will get errors**.

Then run the `gui_own.py` file

# Controls:

* `Left-Click` enter number in a grid

* `Right-Click` activate pencil

* `Tab` use hint

* `Del` delete number or pencil marks in the cell

* `Space` let the AI solve the puzzle for you

# Note

* This program uses the [backtracking algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Backtracking) to generate and solve the puzzles. On rare ocassions, the AI may fail, or the puzzle generation can take a while.
* Everytime, when the AI reaches the last cell, it will take a while to place a number. That is because of how backtracking worksðŸ˜¥
